# Follows You?

A Chrome extension helps you check if a user is following you on GitHub. 

## Screenshots

### When a user follows you:
![](./assets/screenshot2.png)

### When a user is not following you:
<img src="./assets/screenshot3.png" alt="screenshot" width="400">


Note: If no tags appear, it does not necessarily mean the user isn't following you; it could be that the extension failed to access GitHub's APIs or encountered other issues. Feel free to report a bug if you experience this problem
